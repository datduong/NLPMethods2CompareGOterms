simDEF is a method that counts the occurrances of words (very similar to Word2vec). This is their [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26708333).

I modified the simDEF code so that it can compare 2 GO terms from 2 different ontologies. The original [code](https://github.com/ahmadpgh/simDEF) only compares terms within a single ontology.
