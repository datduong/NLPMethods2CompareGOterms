(it is too big for Github). This is trained using 1-gram, and 20 GB open access papers on Pubmed. The word vector dimension is 300. We kept stop-words and symbols like +/- sign because they have meanings in biology context. 
Extract the word embedding after you download it. The first line contains # of words in the file (about 900k words), and the word dimension (vector size 300).
