This code was developed in a previous experiment (nearly a year before the newest manuscript). I decided it is best to keep this code on its own. 

This code uses *Anaconda Python 2*. Install python library gensim https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/install.html. 

Download all the scripts in this folder, and also the data in ```DataSource``` (if you haven't done so).
